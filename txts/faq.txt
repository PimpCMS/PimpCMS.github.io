Welcome to the PimpCMS FAQ!


PimpCMS is an easy way to write content for the internet.
We use GitHub pages to host your content and a simple syntax to write pages like this.
Our service -- writing software to empower writing -- is free and always will be.

How do I get started?
Create a GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up. GitHub is gracious enough to host your site! If you already have a GitHub pages url, you're going to need to figure out something clever to get this to work (pull request anyone?)
Fork the PimpCMS repo into your GitHub account. Rename it to "github-usermane".github.io, substituting in your GitHub username so that GitHub pages will know to generate your site.
Add and/or modify content. You can do this entirely in GitHub, with there text editor. In the /txts folder, you can add a new file by clicking the + button next to the current path in the repository.


What's the writing format like?
Copy and paste this text into a text editor to see the exact formatting. We hope the structure should become clear by reading the plain text.
You must save the files as plain text (.txt) Our parser will have issues reading .doc and .rtf files.
