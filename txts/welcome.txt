Welcome to PimpCMS


Congrats on getting set up!
Time to start writing. This file is in the /txts folder. Feel free to modify this file, or create new text files in the /txts folder. Any files created elsewhere will be ignored.
Formatting is easy. We use a simple heirarchy: one title, followed by any number of paragraphs, each with one topic sentence, followed by any number of supporting statements. Copy and paste this text into a text editor to see the exact formatting.

Should I keep using this?
We believe you can build a message more effectively. Scattering your thoughts across separate bodies of text makes them hard to assess. We help you deliver your message to the world in a single, cohesive message.
Meaning evolves over time. That's why we use Git to manage your content. Every update is like a new draft, and no draft is final.
Write like you were taught to write. The format here is structured to be like paragraphs. We hope you find it simple and expressive.
